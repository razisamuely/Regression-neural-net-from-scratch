# Regression neural-network from scratch

### If you asking for practical example for regression neural net from scratch and all you find till now is blogs about classification neural net,you are in the right place


The notebook contains code for generating neural-net for regression from scratch using numpy only


Run notebook online on google colab - [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lihvcptf5A9GRIMMs7BP9wiq4KFPlmPh?usp=sharing) - no installations is needed.

the results which you need to expect for are as follows:

for RELU transition function
